# Vitadb-Downloader
A script to download Rinnegatamante's database at once.(http://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/)

# Instructions
For the script to work you need the jq command-line JSON processor available at https://github.com/stedolan/jq

You can get it from your package manager.

It is recommended to make 2 folders for your homebrews and plugins.The script will save all the files to the current working dir.

# NOTES
I know this script is inefficient so i welcome anyone with some good ideas.
In the near future i might add the ability to continue the download from the last file you got without prompting the user for input.
~~Also the ability to autocreate the folders.(xD)
